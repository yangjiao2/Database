This project is split into two parts

Part 1 contains Part 1 and Part 2 from the write up, added to the backend implemented
in project 1. The added methods are
addMovie and errorReport

Two additional files support the added functionality.



Part 2 contains Part 3 from the write up, implemented as a text based interface.

Please note to run these files on your machine, you will need to set the password for
your root account.

In ErrorReport.java, you will need to set the path of the output file to a blank html file.
